## Overview
This is a new javascript project speacially created to practice fetch requests and consuming an API. I chose a game style 'high/low' but using the price of different crypto-currencies. In this way, the user have to predict (guess) the price of the asset within 5 seconds. 
 
### The challenge
Basically consists in an app concepts of HTML/CSS/JS. I had to think how to do the differents features that I wanted to implement and I learned a lot because I had never worked with API's before for getting information like this time. It was really interesting to understand how to work the async functions that wait data from the server. I enjoyed working on this project and I'm pleased with my work too.

## My process
I've chosen the idea by myself while I was looking for API's to consume. Then I looked for the Binance API so I thought about making a page with the price of different currencies but it's very usual so I wanted to make something a little bit interesting and I chose the high/low with some crypto-currencies. I selected some currencies in the top of the market capitalization because I need volatility as the game is based in the price-changing.

### Built with

- Desktop first workflow
- Responsive design
- Flexbox/Grid concepts
- Control version system using Git
- JavaScript vanilla

### What I learned
In this project I learned more than the previous and that's important. I worked with real API's for first time and I understood how to manage it. Then I used more async functions to display the info and handle the different functions of the app.
It was a challenge to make everything work well but I started with an idea and I was be able to get it. I'll keep working and improving on it.

### Continued development
I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially more about javascript in order to create dynamic webs and amazing web-experiences.
